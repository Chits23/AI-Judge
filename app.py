    AI Judge is an application designed to assist in crime classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

    ### How it works:
    - **Crime Description Input:** Users can input a description of a crime into the text area provided.
    - **Prediction:** After submitting the crime description, the application uses a fine-tuned BERT model to predict the relevant sections of law (e.g., IPC sections) that may be applicable to the crime.
    - **Result Display:** The predicted sections of law are displayed, providing users with insights into the legal aspects of the crime.

    ### Benefits:
    - **Efficiency:** Quickly identifies relevant sections of law based on crime descriptions.
    - **Accuracy:** Utilizes advanced NLP techniques and a fine-tuned BERT model for precise predictions.
    - **Accessibility:** Easy-to-use interface accessible to legal professionals, law enforcement personnel, and the general public.

    ### Disclaimer:
    AI Judge is intended for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as legal advice. Always consult with a qualified legal professional for legal matters.
